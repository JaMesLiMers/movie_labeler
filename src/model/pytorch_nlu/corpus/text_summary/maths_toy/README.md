介绍
Introduction: 

Automatic text summarization is widely regarded as the highly difficult problem, partially because of the lack of large text summarization data set. Due to the great challenge of constructing the large scale summaries for full text, we introduce a Large-scale Chinese Short Text Summarization dataset constructed from the Chinese microblogging website SinaWeibo. This corpus consists of over 2 million real Chinese short texts with short summaries given by the writer of each text. We also manually tagged the relevance of 10,666 short summaries with their corresponding short texts. Based on the corpus, we introduce recurrent neural network for the summary generation and achieve promising results, which not only shows the usefulness of the proposed corpus for short text summarization research, but also provides a baseline for further research on this topic.
